## Documentation

Some changes were made to the original mock-up:

- The section titles were too small, so they were given a style that stands out in terms of hierarchy compared to the rest of the content in each section.
- A more readable font with necessary typographic variations was chosen.
The Awards section was distributed across 100% of the page for better organization of the cards.

## Suggestions to enhance development

- It is recommended to incorporate some animations when scrolling down.
- During development and compilation, Vite issues a warning regarding an argument that will be deprecated in future updates. This is specific to the Bootstrap version, so it is recommended to update to the latest version.
